## Disclaimer
Some assets have been pre-migrated up to a point where the whole content compiles properly, but have not been properly tested. Anything that is not referenced in `PrimalGameData_QoLPlus` or `ModDataAsset_QoLPlus` still need some more work to be considered production-ready, but they can be played around if wanted.

## Ini settings

Every QoL+ settings must appear under the tag `[QoLPlus]` in the GameUserSettings.ini configuration file (under `\ShooterGame\Saved\Config` for clients, under `\ShooterGame\Saved\Config\WindowsServer` on servers running on Windows)

If you were using `S+` in Ark: Survival Evolved: the name of the settings did not change, only the header must be changed from `[StructuresPlus]` to `[QoLPlus]`.
